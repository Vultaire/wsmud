----------------------------------------------------------------------

Code 24 explanation (RFC 1091):

Aard is doing IAC DO TERMINAL-TYPE(24), meaning Aard is willing to receive terminal
type info.  (If it was IAC WILL TERMINAL-TYPE, then Aard would be willing to send
the terminal info.)

Client would respond with IAC WILL TERMINAL-TYPE or IAC WONT TERMINAL-TYPE

Server then responds with IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE SEND(1) IAC SE.

Client then sends IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE IS(0) ... IAC SE.

Server may repeat the request; if it does, the client should send a
new option if possible.  If not possible, the client should re-send
the same response.  In the case of *another* repeated request, the
client should then go back to the first item.

This seems to be truly intended for real terminal emulation...  Might
just want to ask Lasher about his intent with supporting this, and if
he thinks there's any real need on the WebSocket client.  (I'm leaning
towards "no").

NOTE: IF this is done, getting an Aardwolf implementation is simple
and a good first goal.  Getting a full-blown implementation is harder,
but maybe can be left to others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Code 31 explanation (RFC 1073):

Aard is suggesting that NAWS should be used via IAC DO NAWS(31).

The client should respond with IAC WILL NAWS or IAC WONT NAWS.

The client should then send width/height via IAC SB NAWS <16-bit width>
<16-bit height> IAC SE.  Integers are in "standard byte and bit
order", i.e. big endian.

The client can repeat the above command at any time, unless the server
follows up with IAC WONT NAWS, in which case further requests are
pointless.

Verdict: not sure how Aard actually uses this; it seems of limited
value for a browser-based client.  Maybe ask Lasher?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Code 102 (Mud-specific extensions)

Docs:
- MUSHclient release notes:
  http://www.gammon.com.au/scripts/showrelnote.php?version=4.31&productid=0
- "Help telopts" on Aardwolf

Server wants client to send 102 stuff:
Server: IAC DO 102
Client: IAC WILL 102

Server wants to send client 102 stuff:
Server: IAC WILL 102
Client: IAC DO 102

If both received: full duplex enabled.

Either direction: IC SB 102 x y IAC SE

Notes imply that there could be more bytes... but it seems that right
now it's purely a 2 byte sequence?  Of course, double-check what "help
telopts" says.

From wsmud's perspective: handle the negotiation, fire events for
tx/rx enabled, and fire events for messages from the server.  Plugins
or components which need to do the inverse will wait to get the "tx
enabled" message before proceeding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another development thread: consider configuration save/load
============================================================

Aard-specific enhancements are nice, but if the basic
alias/trigger/macro functionality isn't there, then it's almost
pointless.

We can use the HTML 5 file API as a naive first step, but I think
there's a 5MB limit; this cramps powerusers a bit and might even cramp
casual users with a lot of plugins and/or configuration.  Plus, this
doesn't accomplish one of the app's goals: portable configurations
that don't require taking the client with you.

This implies either storage on the site running the app (not
preferred, but doable), or reliance on popular cloud storage
(e.g. Google Drive and Dropbox).  I lean towards the latter.

Integration w/ Dropbox
======================

At client load, display this dialog::

  +------------------------------------------------+
  | Connect                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | Returning users: Load configuration from:      |
  |   [Dropbox] [Google Drive]                     |
  |                                                |
  | Host: [                ]  Port: [        ]     |
  |                             [Connect] [Cancel] |
  +------------------------------------------------+

On client exit (preferably via a menu, but maybe also on attempted
navigate-away): display this dialog::

  +------------------------------------------------+
  | Save configuration?                            |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | You appear to have an unsaved or changed       |
  | configuration.  Would you like to save it?     |
  | Click the appropriate button below.            |
  |                                                |
  |   [Dropbox] [Google Drive]      [Don't save]   |
  +------------------------------------------------+

*Maybe* show an extra button, [Cancel], if this is displayed as result
of an attempted navigate-away?

Maybe have a third option, to save to a custom HTTP-based file store?

- Would have to consider authentication (maybe basic HTTP with
  immediately-queried creds?).

- Would have to have a url for the resource.

- Read via simple GET (w/ creds if needed), write via simple PUT (w/
  creds if needed).

- Could replace URLs with shorter names, or perhaps remove the URLs
  completely and just show a custom label (e.g. [Aardwolf-provided
  storage]) if things can be configured ahead of time,
  e.g. config_url=http://aardmud.org/wsmud/configs/$user/config.json.
  In this case, it may just be a simple credential prompt when the
  button is clicked.


Dropbox-specific:

- Quickest, for now, to make a "drop-in" app and use their "chooser"
  and "saver" widgets.  Just need an API key; this can be easily done.

- "saver" can take filename suggestions.

- "chooser" seems to allow for preferred extensions, but not a
  preferred file - but this is based on browsing the tutorial; maybe
  there is an option I haven't seen yet.  Still, not a show-stopper.

  - "direct" link can be specified via options; file can then be
    downloaded directly via JS via a special 4-hour lifetime link
    which also supports CORS.  Basically: this supports what we
    need. :)
